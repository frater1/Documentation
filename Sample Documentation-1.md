## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It’s easy to learn and supported by many platforms, including GitHub and Joplin.

> **Tip:** Joplin’s live preview lets you see how your Markdown renders as you write.

## Installation

To get started with Joplin:

- **Download Joplin:** Visit [Joplin's official website](https://joplinapp.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.
- **Install Joplin:** Run the installer and follow the instructions.
- **Create a Notebook:** Open Joplin and create a new notebook for your documentation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use Markdown to format your text. Here are some common elements:

- **Headers:** Use `#` for headers. For example, `# Header 1` or `## Header 2`.
- **Bold Text:** Use `**bold text**`.
- **Italics:** Use `*italic text*`.
- **Lists:** Use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
- **Links:** Use `[link text](URL)`.

## Code Example

Below is a Python code snippet as an example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
